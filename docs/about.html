            <a name="intro"></a>
            <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>
              Acquiring productive capabilities in a wider range of goods
              is a key driver of economic growth and development. Countries typically
              diversify their economies as they pull out of poverty and only
              start to specialise (and innovate) at a relatively late stage of the development
              process — a pattern well documented in terms of
              <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2003/00000093/00000001/art00004" target="_blank">production, employment</a> and
              <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00078#.WGYYERJ95hE" target="_blank">exports</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developing countries must learn to produce and export new products,
              but most economists warn not to try ‘picking winners’ and
              <a href="http://hajoonchang.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DPRLin-Changdebate.pdf" target="_blank">do not agree</a>
              whether industrial policy should conform to or defy comparative advantage.
              Yet policy makers need to prioritise
              <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1824519" target="_blank">limited</a>
              administrative capabilities. A prerequisite for a successful
              industrial policy is the identification of new industries that are
              (or can become) economically feasible  —
              areas of ‘latent comparative advantage’.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how can policy makers identify these
              sectors? Justin Lin's
              <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1611526" target="_blank">
                Growth Identification and Facilitation</a> framework proposes a simple
                if ad-hoc approach, which is probably followed in some form by most
                countries:
              <p>
                <blockquote>
                The government in a developing country can identify the list of tradeable
                goods and services that have been produced for about
                20 years in dynamically growing countries with similar endowment
                structures and a per capita income that is about 100% higher than
                their own.
              </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              Research into economic complexity may provide
              a more data-driven solution. Global trade data is mined to
              <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/network/hs92/export/usa/all/show/2014/" target="_blank">map</a>
              out the network of possible exports and the paths of productive knowledge
              between then. Policy makers can then restrict their attention to
              industries that are close to their current productive structure but
              offer the opportunity to move into denser areas of the
              product space.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Export Predictor applies the intuition of Lin's
              approach in a systemic manner inspired by the product space.
              Rather than measuring the distance between products, the focus is
              the proximity of countries. Economically feasible industries are
              identified based on the comparative advantage of ‘nearby’ countries.
              Multiple measures of country distance are combined in a machine
              learning model trained to predict export discoveries.

            <h3>Country proximity</h3>
            <p>
              The <a href="https://comtrade.un.org/" target="_blank">UN Comtrade Database</a>
              is used to measure distance between countries along the following dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Products exported</strong> (how similar countries are in terms of
                the products they export).</li>
              <li><strong>Products imported</strong> (how similar countries are in terms of
                  the products they import).</li>
              <li><strong>Destination of exports</strong> (how similar countries are in terms
                  the countries they export to).</li>
              <li><strong>Origin of imports</strong> (how similar countries are in terms
                  the countries they import from).</li>
              <li><strong>Bilateral trade intensity</strong> (the value of trade between two
                  countries, normalised by their share of global trade).</li>
              <li><strong>Geographic distance</strong> (the number of kilometers between each capital
                city).</li>
           </ul>
           <p>

           <a name="predictions"></a>
           <h3>Export predictions</h3>
           <p>
             The objective is to predict ‘export discoveries’. To limit
             noise in the data, a country is considered to
             have discovered a new product after exporting it for three
             consecutive years. Likewise, only products not exported for three
             consecutive years are considered potential new discoveries. UN
             Comtrade data is used to identify all export discoveries over the last
             two decades based on this definition.
           </p>
           <p>
             The neighbours of each country (according to the proximity measures defined above)
             are ranked. The
             <span class="gTerm" style="cursor:help;"
             title="revealed comparative advantage is defined as the share of a country's exports accounted for by a product, normalised by that product's share in global trade.">
             comparative advantage</span>
             of each neighbour in each potential new export is then computed.
             To increase predictive power and tractability,
             the comparative advantage of all the neighbours is projected on to the
             most discriminative direction with respect to export discoveries
             in the previous time period (using Linear Discriminants Analysis).
             The model also takes account of the past export discovery rate
             for each country and product.
           </p>
           <p>
             Finally, a machine learning model based on
             <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>
             is trained to predict the probability of a given country discovering
             a given product. Predictions for the
             next three years can be explored
             <a href="dashboard.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
           </p>
           <a name="evaluation"></a>
           <h3>Model evaluation</h3>
           <p>
             The emergence of new export industries is relatively rare: the
             discovery rate is around 3%. The probability ranking across products
             or countries is as or more important than obtaining a correct binary
             classification (export discovery or not). In these situations, the
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic" target="_blank">
             receiver operating characteristic (ROC)</a> curve is often used
             to evaluate a model’s predictions. This a plot of
             the true-positive rate against the false positive rate at different
             discrimination (probability) thresholds, using out-of-sample data.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the ROC curve below was generated by training the model on
            data from 1996 to 2012 and evaluating its predictions against the actual
            export discoveries between 2013 and 2015. The potential new
            exports with a predicted probability of at least 3%
            include almost all of the true positives (products that were indeed
            discovered). However, almost 20% of these products were not discovered
            (were false positives). Using a higher threshold will eliminate
            most false positives, but at the cost of excluding products that
            were discovered.
           </p>
           <img width="700" src="images/roc_curve_no_labels.png" onmouseover="hover(this);" onmouseout="unhover(this);" />
           <p>
             The area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides a measure of the model’s
             overall performance, or more specifically how well it ranks the
             probabilities of potential exports. An AUC of 0.5 indicates the model is no better
             than a random guess, whereas a score of 1 indicates no false positives
             and no false negatives. When evaluated with the most recent data, the export
             prediction model scores around 0.95 (see chart below). This means
             that 95% of the time a randomly chosen product
             that is discovered will have a higher predicted probability than
             a randomly chosen product that is not. The model’s performance
             continues to improve as more data becomes available, providing
             assurance future predictions should be no less reliable.
            <img width="700" src="images/Leave-last-year-out cross validation.png"/>
           </p>
           <a name="modifications"></a>

           <h3>Possible modifications</h3>
           <p>
             The Export Predictor was designed for policy makers in developing
             countries. The model does not generate useful predictions for
             industrialised and large emerging economies that already
             export most of the (around 1,200) products in the database. But the
             <a href="https://github.com/peterjrichens/TradeExplorer" target="_blank">source code</a>
             could be modified with these types of country in mind. For example:
           </p>
           <ul>
             <li>The definition of a product discovery could be changed to only
                 consider exports above a certain threshold or with <span class="gTerm" style="cursor:help;"
                title="the share of a country's exports accounted for by a product, normalised by that product's share in global trade.">
                revealed comparative advantage</span>.</li>
             <li>The model could be re-trained using more disaggregated data, for
                 example HS 6-digit level of classification rather than the
                 4-digit level currently used.</li>
          </ul>
